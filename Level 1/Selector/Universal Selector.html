    <p>Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degree. Ever so slowly, hte room beginsto heat up.<br>
    Twenty-six degrees.<br>
    Twenty-seven.<br>
    Twenty-eight.<br>
    The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.
    Twenty-nine degrees.<br>
    Thirty.<br>
    Thirty-one.<br>
    Still nothing has happend.<br>
    Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no diffrent from the temprature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.
