    <h1>What progress is really like</h1>
    <p>Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degree. Ever so slowly, hte room beginsto heat up.
    Twenty-six degrees.
    Twenty-seven.
    Twenty-eight.
    The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.
    Twenty-nine degrees.
    Thirty.
    Thirty-one.
    still nothing has happend.
    Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no diffrent from the temprature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.
